# Wine-Quality-Classifier
The goal of this project is to build classifiers capable of predicting whether a wine is of high or low quality based on the pH levels, acidity, alcohol content, and other physicochemical properties.

For further information on this project please check out the [Report](Wine_Quality_Classifier_Report.pdf) authored by Me and [AidanR04](https://github.com/AidanR04).
